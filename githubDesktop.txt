GitHub desktop version 1.6.5\
\
annoying thing when you run githuib desktop for the first time ->let\'92s get started window\
I ran into this and wanted to document it before I left the first run splash page\
The desktop app dosent bring you to your GitHub home, instead it offers options that you(I) don\'92t want\
Clone a repository\
Create a new repository on your hard drive\
Add an existing repository from your hard drive\
\
Not any bad ideas but just not what I needed because I did this all from the web and command line all ready\
I\'92m looking for a control to get me to my repositories as they are, can\'92t find any way to do it\
Looking\'85\
\
Ok first thing I notice is the menu Giyhub desktop > install command line tool.  Click this and install\
\
No menu or other click will get you out of this mess to the application\
\
I\'92m going to choose create a new repository on your hard drive\
Hope it will let me choose the location\'85 calling it stupidAssGithubDesktopApp\
\
The dialogue does let you choose the folder location so I named my new repo githubDesktopApp\
\
This fucking piece of shit app crashed in the create a new repository dialog\
\
Closing and restarting just for fun\'85app doesn\'92t quit when clicking on close (Mac-red circle)\
it still remains on the bar-it\'92s a Mac thing\
\
When you click the icon on app bar it reopens in the crashed state and displays the dialog which is still frozen\
\
Go to the menu Github Desktop and choose quit GitHub desktop. Then reopen the application from finder and try again\
Again choose create a repository on your hard drive. \
Give it a name and choose the folder to create the repository in\
Not sure if this will create repo here or create a new folder underneath\
\
Yes it did create a folder underneath. I have all my repositories in a folder called \'93repositories\'94\
This created one more level of folder than I wanted. No complaint - lesson learned*\
Next time choose folder above repositories. Begrudgingly have to say it makes sense\
\
Now - can I see the other repositories that I have on GitHub.com?\
No I can\'92t. Even though I logged into the app with my GitHub login \'97 this is fucking useless\
\
Ok wait let\'92s try to create a repository from hard drive folder\
\
First I\'92ll restart the shitty app\
So restarted and repository still there. Noticed that repository is local only so that\'92s why it isn\'92t showing up in GitHub.com \
It\'92s giving me a publish repository. Let\'92s try it\
\
Well I\'92ll be dammed! I created a new branch with the GitHub app and it checkout the brand in my local repository as shown in the command line terminal\
\
Ok adding this file which is in a different folder right now. Going to move it to GithubDesktop repo folder. I can see a problem right now>the file is an rtf. Probably will need to change extension\
Let\'92s try it first\
